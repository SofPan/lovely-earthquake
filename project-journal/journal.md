# Development Journal - Meditation App

### Sunday, October 20, 2024

Day one! I spent my time planning the app, including user stories, routes, and an ERD. I am planning to focus a lot of my time on this really tightening up my CSS and JS animation skills. I want something really clean (user-facing and code-wise), and I want it to be beautiful and minimalist. There will be some small degree of full-stack because I want to always showcase that I am capable of doing it all. 

Next session plans:
  * Decide my stack
  * Set up folder structure
  * Connect to remote repo
  * Create Database & seed
  * Connect backend to frontend & manipulate the DB

Going to give this an hour today and see how it comes along. Probably going to stick to the basic PERN stack, I want to work in what I know so I can really focus on putting out something beautiful and minimalist.

...

Yeah, decided to go with PERN. I got my dependencies installed and I have my Database set up. MAN am I tired of running into .env trouble with my DB though!!

So things I learned today, one, you MUST install node modules in the appropriate front/back end folder. In this case, I couldn't see my environment variables because I had installed dotenv as a root node module instead of server-side. Once I had that going, I was able to seed my test data with a few fixes here and there.

It took me the whole hour to install dependencies and seed the database, but at least that is out of the way. Going to commit and stop here for tonight, and pick up again later this week.

Next session plans:
  * Create API
  * Connect backend to frontend & manipulate the DB
  * Prepare basic React components structure
  * Research JS/React animations libraries

I plan to work on the API routes tonight, I'll start with one and make sure I can fetch what I need, then go from there. I should review how to use curl properly while I'm at it since I didn't practice with it very much in school.
