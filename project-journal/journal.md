# Development Journal - Meditation App

### Sunday, October 20, 2024

Day one! I spent my time planning the app, including user stories, routes, and an ERD. I am planning to focus a lot of my time on this really tightening up my CSS and JS animation skills. I want something really clean (user-facing and code-wise), and I want it to be beautiful and minimalist. There will be some small degree of full-stack because I want to always showcase that I am capable of doing it all. 

Next session plans:
  * Decide my stack
  * Set up folder structure
  * Connect to remote repo
  * Create Database & seed
  * Connect backend to frontend & manipulate the DB
